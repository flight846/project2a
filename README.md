# Project_2A - Rails CRUD application

This project was done in General Assembly Web Development Immersive Course. Students are taught and make projects during their 3 months full time in campus learning.

This simple Q & A app allows users to view, create, edit and delete qusetions and answers. Questions have a title and body (of content) ans users can answer and vote. 

The development is done in a test-driven manner based on test files provided in the 'spec' folder.

The app is currently hosted on the Heroku platform: [Query.Me](https://intense-river-14194.herokuapp.com/)

###Technology
The technology used include:

- Ruby on Rails (ruby 2.3.0p0, rails 4.2.5);
- Boostrap 3.3;
- Postgres (in production);

###How it works
By default, users are shown a list of all questions posted by users, and are able to view them individually. Users can also answers to questions and vote on them.

Users can create their own accounts through 'Sign Up' functionality. When logging into their accounts, they are then able to create, edit and destroy blog posts.
